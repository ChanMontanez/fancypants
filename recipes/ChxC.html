Chicken Cacciatore

<div class="intro">
	<p>I adore chicken cacciatore, but I often find that tradional recipes aren't quite as flavorful as I'd like. I've tweeked this just a bit by adding basil, flavoring the flour, and adding more oregano than is normally called for.</p>

		Heat a heavy bottomed pan over medium high heat with about a tablespoon of olive oil. place the thighs in skin side down and saute until golden brown, about three to five minutes on each side. Don't worry about cooking it through we'll come back to it later. place the chicken on a plate and set aside.
		Lower the burner to medium heat, add the onions to the same pan the chicken was just in, sprinkle with a bit of salt and saute until they are almost translucent. add the garlic and continue sauteing until the onions are translucent. Once the onions are translucent add the  wine/broth, cook until the liquid is reduced by half. Add the tomatoes, tomato paste and oregano.
		Bring the sauce to a simmer and allow it to cook for thiry minutes.Season to taste with the salt and pepper.</p>

		Place the chicken thighs into the sauce, sprinkle with the basil and allow the chicken to simmer for another thirty minutes if you like, you can allow it to simmer for longer.</p>
