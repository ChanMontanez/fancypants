		Hard Candy

	<div class="intro">
		<p>
			I have a sweet tooth like you would not believe. The problem is that I'm also really picky. One day it hit me that I could make my own candy. This thought has been both a boon and a problem, luckily I have a number of friends who have selflessly offered to take any extra candies off of my hands.
		</p>
		<p>
			With a little creativity you can make just about any flavor of hard candy or lollipop you can think of.

		 <div class="p2">
			 *You'll need some "hardware" for this recipe. A candy thermometer and either parchment paper or a silpat are essential. If you want to make lollipops, you can either use a mold of your choice or create them free handed, I'll explain below.

		<h2>Hard Candy</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="recipe">
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
		<li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
		<li>1 cup water</li>
		<li>1 to 2 ounces flavoring **</li>
		<li>candy molds, lollipop molds, or a silicone mat*</li>
		<li>candy Thermometer</li>
		<li>food coloring, optional</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="dir">

	<p>
		Put sugar, corn syrup, and water into a heavy bottomed pan and cook over medium heat. Bring to a boil.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bring to 309 degrees fahrenhiet. At this point you can add any flavoring or coloring you like.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pour into candy or lollipop molds. If you're using a silicone sheet, you can pour the candy into small circles for candy drops, or to make lollipops you can pour a circle of candy, quickly presss a lollipop stick into it and pour just a little more candy over the stick.
		Allow the candy to cool fully before eating it.
	</p>

	<p>
		 If you want squares, pour the candy into a square pan that has been lined with parchment paper. Once the very top of the candy has cooled just enought to form a "skin," use a bench scraper or metal spatula to gently press lines into the candy to form a grid. The squares can be as large or small as you'd like. You are ony trying to mark the candy, not slice through it. Once you have finished creating your grid, allow it to cool completely. Once cooled, it can be easily broken it apart into your squares.

		<h4>A few notes</h4>
	</p>
	<p>
		*If you're using molds, especially non-silicone ones, make sure they are oiled.
	</p>
	<p>
		**For flavoring you can use a commercially made flavoring oil, a homemade flavoring oil, or you cand use crushed herbs or spices. If you use an herb or spice, you can throw them into the boiling candy a few moments before pouring the candy into molds.
	</p>

	<p>
		 For a fruit flavored candy, like the strawberry drops pictured above, add up to 2 oz or 1/4 cup of finely chopped fruit at the end of cook time or at about 290 degrees. As soon as the mixture comes up to 309 degrees fahrehiet, pour or mold it as you wish.
