  		<p>
          I love citrus. Truth be told, limes are my favorite, but I love all of them. This pie reminds me of lemon bars but with fruit slices added in. If you want a pie thats all orange, go for it! Lemon and lime?  Do it up! Just make sure that the the amount, or more specifically the weight of fruit, is equal to the amount in the recipe.

				If you dont want to make your own pie dough, don't. Plenty of companies make perfectly delicous pie crusts, so just pick your favorite. If you want to fancy this up with a lattice top, it would be lovely with the sunny color shining through. If you don't care for the upper crust, skip it. I'm all for making a recipe your own.
