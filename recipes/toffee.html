	Mexican Toffee
</div>

<div class="intro">
	<p>
  A different take on one of my favorite candies.
  The beauty of this recipe is that the spices, the chocolate, and the pepitas are all interchangeable. If you want to make a classic english toffee, use your favorite nut instead of the pepitas for the coating and omit the spices. You can use milk, bitter sweet, or even white chocolate or any combination there of instead of the dark chocolate. There are infinite possiblities that are only limited by your imagination.
	 <div class="p2">
		 *While this recipe is infinitely variable, I urge you not to replace the sugar, butter, or corn syrup. First and foremost this is candy, not health food.

<p>
Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat and set aside.
</p>
<p>
In a medium, thick-bottomed saucepan over medium/med-low heat add the butter.  		Once the butter softens and starts to melt, stir in the sugar, corn syrup, and water. Cook, stirring regularly until the mixture is bubbling (lava-style) and the candy thermometer hits 300F degrees. Remove from the heat and stir the spices and one cup of the pepitas.
</p>
<p>
Pour the hot toffee out onto the prepared baking sheet. Depending on how thick you like your toffee, spread it out into a round 10-12-inches wide. Set it aside to cool.
</p>
<p>
While the toffee is cooling go ahead and melt half the, either in a microwave in 20-second bursts or in a double boiler. Be sure the toffee has set up  before you spread the melted chocolate over the top. Immediately sprinkle with 1/2 cup of the pepitas and a bit of sea salt.
</p>
<p>
Wait until the chocolate has firmed up. Carefully flip the toffee over. Melt the remaining chocolate and spread on the second side - sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of pepitas and a bit of the sea salt. Allow to cool.
</p>
<p>
I've seen people break brittle or toffee into big shards by smacking the baking pan on the counter. If this doesn't work for you, break the toffee into pieces by (carefully) using a knife or ice pick to break of pieces.
</p>
<p>
Makes enough toffee to last me about a week or one party. your usage may vary, but I certainly should not be left alone with it.
